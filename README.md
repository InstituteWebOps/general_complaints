# General complaints
General Complaints is modelled more like a complaints forum than a portal. The structure will be
similar to ‘Hostel Complaints’ bearing few changes. All complaints will be full featured as in
students can comment, add tags, upvote and downvote. There will be a trending section where
all the happening complaint discussions will be shown. Again tags can be addressed to
secretaries ( #litsec , #sgs ) or anything trending in the institute ( #studentsapp ). You can search
these tags in the search bar and all the complaints possessing these tags will be populated. A
separate UI will be built for the secretaries where in they can view all the complaints specifically
addressed to them. Again spam controls will be in place.
